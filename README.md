This file is meant for the Raccoon team.

This was a midterm project in my last JavaScript class. The assignment was to develop a Web card game similar to Blackjack. There were many key components to keep in mind, but the only real restriction was to develop everything in OOP, leveraging ES6 classes.

I chose to submit this project since it was my first real experience with OOP in JavaScript. At first, it seemed a bit overwhelming, but I had a breakthrough - a Aha! moment - and finally saw the real potential/power of OOP in JavaScript.

Since then, if it lends itself to the occasion, I always try to develop in OOP with ES6 classes.

Feel free to reach out if you have any question/comment regarding this project.

Thank you!
